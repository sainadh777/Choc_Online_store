<h3>Milk Chocolates</h3>
<img id="product" src="milk.jpg" alt="loading image"/>
<p>Sweet and creamy milk chocolate isn’t usually made with cold, frothy milk. 
It’s usually made with dry milk solids, which look like powdered milk. Milk chocolate has at least 
10 percent cocoa liquor by weight,
 and at least 12 percent milk solids. It’s the most common kind of eating chocolate.
 Chocolate liquor, served straight up, is all that’s in baking chocolate. Its bitterness comes from
 pure nibs, the finely ground centers of roasted cocoa beans. Also called unsweetened chocolate, it 
 has no sugar and is used often in dessert recipes with sugar as a separate ingredient. All other chocolate is called eating chocolate.
 <br/>Our all-milk selection features assorted milk chocolates, truffles, biscuits, pretzels, bars, even hot cocoa.</p>

 <h3>Dark Chocolates</h3>  
<img id="product" src="dark.jpg" alt="loading image"/>
<p>Dark chocolate is simply chocolate liquor, extra cocoa butter, sugar, an emulsifier 
 and vanilla or other flavorings. Dark chocolates may contain milk fat to soften the texture,
 but they do not generally have a milky flavor.Dark chocolate also is known as semi-sweet chocolate.
 Unsweetened chocolate, or baking chocolate, is 100 percent chocolate liquor and is typically very 
 bitter and astringent.Darker chocolates often have a higher percent cacao, which means they have a 
 higher proportion of cocoa beans in them than other chocolates do.These coatings may contain chocolate liquor and/or cocoa powder, but use vegetable fats to supplement or replace cocoa butter. While often used to cover confectionery or ice cream products,
 they can be molded into solid bars or shapes.</p>

<h3>Truffles</h3>
<img id="product" src="truffles.jpg" alt="loading image"/>
<p>A chocolate truffle is a type of chocolate confectionery, traditionally made with a chocolate
 ganache centre coated in chocolate, cocoa powder or chopped toasted nuts typically hazelnuts, 
 almonds or coconut,usually in a spherical, conical, or curved shape.The chocolate truffle is thought to have been first created by Bertha.
 They reached a wider public with the establishment of the Bertha's chocolate ,which still sells "Napoleon III" truffles to the original recipe.
 There are now three main types of chocolate truffles:The "French truffle" is made with fresh cream and chocolate and then rolled into cocoa or nut powder.
The "Belgian truffle" or praline is made with dark or milk chocolate filled with ganache, buttercream or nut pastes.
The "Swiss truffle" is made by combining melted chocolate into a boiling mixture of dairy cream and butter, which is poured into
 molds to set before sprinkling with cocoa powder. 
Like the French truffles, these have a very short shelf-life and must be consumed within a few days of making.</p>
