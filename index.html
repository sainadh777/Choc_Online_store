<p>Since Mrs.Bertha founded Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates ,it's been our mission to produce the finest, most gourmet chocolates within the chocolate brand portfolio. Over a century ago, Bertha taught her son  how to make gourmet chocolate candy in her  kitchen, a passion he continued to perfect over many years. Today, we continue their legacy by using the finest ingredients to produce several of Bertha's original recipes for gourmet chocolate and candy. Our passion for craft is never compromised, because we want to ensure that your family and loved ones can enjoy the same unmatched quality of chocolate that the has been enjoying for over 100 years.

<p> Our Chocolates are made of natural ingredients  like:-<br/>
<b>Chocolate Liquor:</b> Cocoa beans with their shells removed that have been fermented, roasted and ground until they liquefy.
<br/><b>Cocoa Butter:</b> Natural fat from the cocoa bean; extra cocoa butter enhances chocolateâ€™s flavor and mouthfeel.<br/>
<b>Lecithin:</b> An emulsifier, often made from soy, that makes the ingredients blend together.<br/>
<b>Vanilla or vanillin and other flavors.</b><br/>
<b>Milk: For milk chocolate.</b><br/>
<b>Fruits, Nuts and other Add-ins: For specialty chocolates.</b>
All of Our's fine-crafted fillings are made in small batches. Each batch of our caramels are made in our original copper kettles. No mass production here.
<p>Our staff of chocolatiers pack each and every box by hand with care. Each box has a personal touch, just for you.</p>
